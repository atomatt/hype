How to install Hype
================================

Hyper is a project that aims to bring the wonderful indexer Hyper to the
python world with a pythonic API.

Dependencies
--------------
- PyRex >= 0.9.4.1 (only for regeneration of the C source file).
- qdbm >= 1.8.XX (libqdbm11 or libqdbm2 in debian unstable)
- hyperestraier >= 1.3.3 (hyperestraier adds new API in each revision though).
- Python >= 2.3.
- py.lib (py.test in particular, needed to run tests).
- dateutil package from Gustavo Niemeyer (http://labix.org/python-dateutil)

If you have a binary based distribution you will also need the -dev version of
libqdbm and hyperestraier.

Hyperestraier is the successor of estraier (which is a different and older
indexer that is now unmaintained), some distributions might decide to
distribute hyperestraier library as libestraier-dev (like debian-unstable
does). Keep this in mind when installing.

Install
--------
After having installed the required bependencies run: 
      	     
	     $ python setup.py build
	     
	     $ sudo python setup.py install

Hype has been tested under Ubuntu, Debian Unstable, Gentoo and OSX.

In order to run the tests you'll need to build hype inplace with the
following command:
	  
	    $ python setup.py build_ext -i

And then you'll be able to run tests with:

    	    $ py.test
